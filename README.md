# Task-4-Feature-Encoding-Scaling-Report
# ML_Task04 – Feature Encoding & Scaling

## Objective
Apply feature encoding and scaling techniques to prepare a dataset for machine learning models.

## Dataset
Adult Income Dataset (`adult.csv`)

## Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset.
2. Handled missing values.
3. Identified categorical and numerical features.
4. Applied Label Encoding where order exists.
5. Applied One-Hot Encoding where order does not exist.
6. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
7. Compared data before and after scaling.
8. Saved the preprocessed dataset.

## Files Included
- `Task4_Feature_Encoding_Scaling.ipynb` – Notebook
- `adult.csv` – Original dataset
- `Adult_Preprocessed.csv` – Preprocessed dataset
- `report.md` – Task explanation

## Outcome
This task strengthened understanding of feature engineering, encoding methods, and the importance of scaling for ML algorithms.
